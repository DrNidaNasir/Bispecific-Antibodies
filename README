# Bispecific Antibodies – Reproducible Graph Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a **research-to-production workflow** for transforming
antibody–antigen structural data into graph representations, following
**CI/CD, Docker, and GitOps principles**.

The goal is to keep exploratory research flexible (Jupyter notebooks)
while ensuring **reproducible, automated execution** suitable for deployment
on cloud platforms.
